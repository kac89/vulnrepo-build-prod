Such agents could potentially locate and exploit hardcoded credentials or exploit weaknesses due to improper credential usage.\nAttack Vectors\n\nExploitability EASY\n\nAdversaries can exploit vulnerabilities in both hardcoded credentials and improper credential usage. Once these vulnerabilities are identified, an attacker can use hardcoded credentials to gain unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities of the mobile app. They can also misuse credentials, for instance by gaining access through improperly validated or stored credentials, thereby bypassing the need for legitimate access.\nSecurity Weakness\n\nPrevalence COMMON\n\nDetectability EASY\n\nPoor implementation of credential management, such as using hardcoded credentials and improper handling, can lead to severe security weaknesses. A comprehensive security testing process should aim to identify these issues. For instance, security testers should attempt to identify hardcoded credentials within the mobile app’s source code or within any configuration files.\nTechnical Impacts\n\nImpact SEVERE\n\nPoor credential management can lead to several significant technical impacts. Unauthorized users might gain access to sensitive information or functionality within the mobile app or its backend systems. This can lead to data breaches, loss of user privacy, fraudulent activity, and potential access to administrative functionality.\nBusiness Impacts\n\nImpact SEVERE\n\nThe business impact of poor credential management, including hardcoded credentials and improper credential usage, can be substantial:\n\n    Reputation Damage;\n    Information Theft;\n    Fraud;\n    Unauthorized Access to Data.\n\nAm I Vulnerable To ‘Improper Credential Usage’?\n\nInsecure credential management can occur when mobile apps use hardcoded credentials or when credentials are misused. Here are some indicators that your mobile app may be vulnerable:\n\n    Hardcoded Credentials - If the mobile app contains hardcoded credentials within the app’s source code or any configuration files, this is a clear indicator of vulnerability.\n    Insecure Credential Transmission - If credentials are transmitted without encryption or through insecure channels, this could indicate a vulnerability.\n    Insecure Credential Storage - If the mobile app stores user credentials on the device in an insecure manner, this could represent a vulnerability.\n    Weak User Authentication - If user authentication relies on weak protocols or allows for easy bypassing, this could be a sign of vulnerability.\n\nHow Do I Prevent ‘Improper Credentials Usage’?\n\nAvoiding insecure credential management involves not using hardcoded credentials and properly handling user credentials.\n\nAvoid Using Hardcoded Credentials\n\nHardcoded credentials can be easily discovered by attackers and provide an easy access point for unauthorized users. Always avoid using hardcoded credentials in your mobile app’s code or configuration files.\n\nProperly Handle User Credentials\n\nUser credentials should always be stored, transmitted, and authenticated securely:\n\n    Encrypt credentials during transmission.\n    Do not store user credentials on the device. Instead, consider using secure, revocable access tokens.\n    Implement strong user authentication protocols.\n    Regularly update and rotate any used API keys or tokens.\n\nExample Attack Scenarios\n\nThe following scenarios showcase improper credentials usage in mobile apps:\n\nScenario #1: Hardcoded Credentials: An attacker discovers hardcoded credentials within the mobile app’s source code. They use these credentials to gain unauthorized access to sensitive functionality within the app or backend systems.\n\nScenario #2: Insecure Credential Transmission: An attacker intercepts insecurely transmitted credentials between the mobile app and its backend systems. They use these intercepted credentials to impersonate a legitimate user and gain unauthorized access.\n\nScenario #3: Insecure Credential Storage: An attacker gains physical access to a user’s device and extracts stored credentials from the mobile app. The attacker uses these credentials to gain unauthorized access to the user’s account.",

        "desc": "Threat Agents\n\nApplication Specific\n\nAn attacker can manipulate application functionality by exploiting vulnerabilities in the mobile app supply chain. For example, an attacker can insert malicious code into the mobile app’s codebase or modify the code during the build process to introduce backdoors, spyware, or other malicious code.\n\nThis can allow the attacker to steal data, spy on users, or take control of the mobile device. Moreover, an attacker can exploit vulnerabilities in third-party software libraries, SDKs, vendors, or hardcoded credentials to gain access to the mobile app or the backend servers.\n\nThis can lead to unauthorized data access or manipulation, denial of service, or complete takeover of the mobile app or device.\nAttack Vectors\n\nExploitability AVERAGE\n\nThere are multiple ways to exploit Inadequate Supply Chain vulnerability for example- an insider threat agent or an attacker can inject malicious code during the development phase of the app, then they can compromise the app signing keys or certificates to sign malicious code as trusted.\n\nAnother way, a threat agent can exploit vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or components used in the app.\nSecurity Weakness\n\nPrevalence COMMON\n\nDetectability DIFFICULT\n\nInadequate Supply Chain vulnerability occurs due to a lack of secure coding practices, insufficient code reviews and testing leading to the inclusion of vulnerabilities in the app.\n\nOther causes for inadequate supply chain vulnerabilities include insufficient or insecure app signing and distribution process, weakness in third-party software components or libraries, insufficient security controls for data, encryption, storage, or exposing sensitive data to unauthorized access.\nTechnical Impacts\n\nImpact SEVERE\n\nIf an attacker successfully exploits inadequate supply chain security, the technical impact can be severe. The specific technical impact depends on the nature of the exploit, but it can include:\n\nData Breach: The attacker can steal sensitive data, such as login credentials, personal data, or financial information. The data breach can have long-term consequences for the affected individuals, such as identity theft or financial fraud.\n\nMalware Infection: The attacker can introduce malware into the mobile application, which can infect the user’s device and steal data or perform malicious activities. The malware can be difficult to detect and remove, and it can cause significant damage to the user’s device and data.\n\nUnauthorized Access: The attacker can gain access to the mobile application’s server or the user’s device and perform unauthorized activities, such as modifying or deleting data. This can result in data loss, service disruption, or other technical issues.\n\nSystem Compromise: The attacker can compromise the entire system of the mobile application, which can lead to a complete loss of control over the system. This can result in the shutdown of the application, significant data loss, and long-term damage to the reputation of the mobile application developer.\nBusiness Impacts\n\nImpact SEVERE\n\nIf an attacker successfully exploits inadequate supply chain security, the business impact can be significant. The specific business impact depends on the nature of the exploit and the organization’s size, industry, and overall security posture, but it can include:\n\nFinancial Losses: The organization can suffer financial losses as a result of the attack, such as the cost of investigating the breach, the cost of notifying affected individuals, or the cost of legal settlements. The organization can also lose revenue if customers lose trust in the mobile application and stop using it.\n\nReputational Damage: The organization can suffer reputational damage as a result of the attack, which can lead to long-term damage to the organization’s brand and customer trust. This can result in reduced revenue and difficulty in attracting new customers.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Consequences: The organization can face legal and regulatory consequences as a result of the attack, such as fines, lawsuits, or government investigations. These consequences can result in significant financial and reputational damage to the organization.\n\nSupply Chain Disruption: The attack can disrupt the organization’s supply chain and lead to delays or interruptions in the delivery of goods or services. This can result in financial losses and reputational damage to the organization.\nAm I vulnerable to ‘Inadequate Supply Chain Vulnerability’?\n\nIt is possible that you are vulnerable to inadequate supply chain vulnerability, particularly if you use mobile applications that are developed by third-party developers or rely on third-party libraries and components. The vulnerability can arise due to a variety of reasons, such as:\n\nLack of Security in Third-Party Components: Third-party components, such as libraries or frameworks, can contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. If the mobile application developer does not vet the third-party components properly or keep them updated, the application can be vulnerable to attacks.\n\nMalicious Insider Threats: Malicious insiders, such as a rogue developer or a supplier, can introduce vulnerabilities into the mobile application intentionally. This can occur if the developer does not implement adequate security controls and monitoring of the supply chain process.\n\nInadequate Testing and Validation: If the mobile application developer does not test the application thoroughly, it can be vulnerable to attacks. The developer may also fail to validate the security of the supply chain process, leading to vulnerabilities in the application.\n\nLack of Security Awareness: If the mobile application developer does not have adequate security awareness, they may not implement the necessary security controls to prevent supply chain attacks.\nHow Do I Prevent ‘Inadequate Supply Chain Vulnerability’?\n\n    Implement secure coding practices, code review, and testing throughout the mobile app development lifecycle to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.\n    Ensure secure app signing and distribution processes to prevent attackers from signing and distributing malicious code.\n    Use only trusted and validated third-party libraries or components to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities.\n    Establish security controls for app updates, patches, and releases to prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities in the app.\n    Monitor and detect supply chain security incidents through security testing, scanning, or other techniques to detect and respond to incidents in a timely manner.\n\nExample Attack Scenarios\n\nScenario #1 Malware Injection\n\nAn attacker injects malware into a popular mobile app during the development phase. The attacker then signs the app with a valid certificate and distributes it to the app store, bypassing the app store’s security checks. Users download and install the infected app, which steals their login credentials and other sensitive data. The attacker then uses the stolen data to commit fraud or identity theft, causing significant financial harm to the victims and reputational damage to the app provider.",

        "title": "M3: Insecure Authentication/Authorization",
        "poc": "",
        "desc": "Threat Agents\n\nApplication Specific\n\nThreat agents that exploit authentication and authorization vulnerabilities typically do so through automated attacks that use available or custom-built tools.\nAttack Vectors\n\nExploitability EASY\n\nOnce the adversary understands the vulnerabilities in either the authentication or authorization scheme, they can exploit these weaknesses in one of two ways. They may either fake or bypass the authentication by directly submitting service requests to the mobile app’s backend server, circumventing any direct interaction with the mobile app, or they can log into the application as a legitimate user after successfully passing the authentication control and then force-browse to a vulnerable endpoint to execute administrative functionality. Both exploitation methods are typically accomplished via mobile malware within the device or botnets owned by the attacker.\nSecurity Weakness\n\nPrevalence COMMON\n\nDetectability AVERAGE\n\nIn order to test for poor authorization and authentication schemes in mobile apps, a number of strategies can be employed by testers. For authorization, testers can perform binary attacks against the mobile app and try to execute privileged functionality that should only be executable with a user of higher privilege, particularly while the mobile app is in ‘offline’ mode. Testers should also attempt to execute any privileged functionality using a low-privilege session token within the corresponding POST/GET requests for the sensitive functionality to the backend server.\n\nPoor or missing authorization schemes can potentially allow an adversary to execute functionality they should not be entitled to using an authenticated but lower-privilege user of the mobile app. This risk of privilege escalation attack is heightened when authorization decisions are made within the mobile device instead of through a remote server, a scenario that can often arise due to the mobile requirements of offline usability.\n\nIn terms of poor authentication schemes, testers can undertake binary attacks against the mobile app while it’s in ‘offline’ mode, aiming to bypass offline authentication and then execute functionality that should require offline authentication. Testers should also try to execute any backend server functionality anonymously by removing any session tokens from any POST/GET requests for the mobile app functionality.\n\nPoor or missing authentication schemes can allow an adversary to anonymously execute functionality within the mobile app or the backend server used by the mobile app. These weaknesses in mobile app authentication are fairly common due to the mobile device’s input form factor, which often encourages short passwords or 4-digit PINs.\n\nMobile apps face unique authentication requirements that can diverge from traditional web authentication schemes, largely due to their varying availability requirements. Unlike traditional web apps where users are expected to be online and authenticate in real-time with a backend server, mobile apps may need to fulfill uptime requirements that necessitate offline authentication due to the unreliability or unpredictability of mobile internet connections. This requirement can significantly impact the factors developers must consider when implementing mobile authentication.\nTechnical Impacts\n\nImpact SEVERE\n\nThe technical impact of poor authorization and authentication in a system can be wide-ranging, significant, and similar, largely depending on the type of over-privileged functionality that is executed. When it comes to poor authorization, for instance, over-privileged execution of remote or local administration functionality may destroy systems or access to sensitive information.\n\nThe technical repercussions of poor authentication occur when the solution is unable to identify the user performing an action request. This can immediately result in the inability to log or audit user activity since the user’s identity cannot be established. This lack of identity verification contributes to an inability to detect the source of an attack, understand the nature of any underlying exploits, or devise strategies to prevent future attacks.\n\nMoreover, failures in authentication can also expose underlying authorization failures. When authentication controls fail, the solution is unable to verify the user’s identity, which is closely tied to a user’s role and associated permissions. If an attacker can anonymously execute sensitive functionality, it indicates that the underlying code is not verifying the permissions of the user issuing the request for the action. Consequently, the anonymous execution of code underscores failures in both authentication and authorization controls.\nBusiness Impacts\n\nImpact SEVERE\n\nThe business impact of poor authentication and authorization will typically result in the following at a minimum:\n\n    Reputation Damage;\n    Information Theft;\n    Fraud;\n    Unauthorized Access to Data.\n\nAm I Vulnerable To ‘Insecure Authentication / Authorization’?\n\nUnderstanding the difference between authentication and authorization is paramount in evaluating mobile application security. Authentication identifies an individual, while authorization verifies if the identified individual has the necessary permissions for a particular action. These two aspects are closely related, as authorization checks should immediately follow mobile device request authentication.\n\nInsecure authorization can occur when an organization fails to authenticate an individual before executing a requested API endpoint from a mobile device, as it is virtually impossible to conduct authorization checks on an incoming request without an established caller’s identity.\n\nHere are some straightforward indicators of insecure authorization:\n\n    Presence of Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities - Noticing an IDOR vulnerability may suggest that the code isn’t conducting a proper authorization check.\n    Hidden Endpoints - Developers might neglect authorization checks on backend hidden functionality, assuming that the hidden functionality will only be accessed by a user with the appropriate role.\n    User Role or Permission Transmissions - Should the mobile app transmit the user’s roles or permissions to a backend system as part of a request, this could signal insecure authorization.\n\nSimilarly, mobile apps can exhibit various signs of insecure authentication:\n\n    Anonymous Backend API Execution - The ability of the app to execute a backend API service request without providing an access token may point to insecure authentication.\n    Local Storage of Passwords or Shared Secrets - If the app stores any passwords or shared secrets locally on the device, this could be a sign of insecure authentication.\n    Weak Password Policy - The use of a simplified password-entering process may imply insecure authentication.\n    Usage of Features like FaceID and TouchID - Employing features like FaceID or TouchID could be indicative of insecure authentication.\n\nHow Do I Prevent ‘Insecure Authentication and Authorization’?\n\nTo prevent both insecure authentication and authorization, it’s crucial to avoid weak patterns and reinforce secure measures.\n\nAvoid Weak Patterns\n\nInsecure Mobile Application Authentication Design Patterns should be avoided:\n\n    If you are porting a web application to a mobile equivalent, ensure the authentication requirements of mobile applications match that of the web application component. It should not be possible to authenticate with fewer factors than the web browser.\n    Local user authentication can lead to client-side bypass vulnerabilities. If the application stores data locally, the authentication routine can be bypassed on jailbroken devices through runtime manipulation or binary modification. If offline authentication is a compelling business requirement, consult additional guidance on preventing binary attacks against the mobile app.\n    Perform all authentication requests server-side, where possible. Upon successful authentication, application data will be loaded onto the mobile device, ensuring application data availability only after successful authentication.\n    If client-side data storage is necessary, encrypt the data using an encryption key securely derived from the user’s login credentials. However, there are additional risks that the data will be decrypted via binary attacks.\n    The “Remember Me” functionality should never store a user’s password on the device.\n    Mobile applications should ideally use a device-specific authentication token that can be revoked within the mobile application by the user, mitigating unauthorized access risks from a stolen/lost device.\n    Avoid using spoof-able values for user authentication, including device identifiers or geo-location.\n    Persistent authentication within mobile applications should be implemented as an opt-in and not enabled by default.\n    Where possible, refrain from allowing users to provide 4-digit PIN numbers for authentication passwords.\n\nReinforce Authentication\n\n    Developers should assume that all client-side authorization and authentication controls can be bypassed by malicious users. Server-side reinforcement of these controls is critical.\n    Due to offline usage requirements, mobile apps might need to perform local authentication or authorization checks. In such cases, developers should instrument local integrity checks to detect any unauthorized code changes. Consult additional guidance on detecting and reacting to binary attacks.\n    Use FaceID and TouchID to unlock biometrically locked secrets and securely protect sensitive authentication materials, like session tokens.\n\nInsecure Authorization Prevention\n\nTo avoid insecure authorization:\n\n    Backend systems should independently verify the roles and permissions of the authenticated user. Do not rely on any roles or permission information that comes from the mobile device.\n    Assume that all client-side authorization can be bypassed, hence reinforcing server-side authorization controls whenever possible.\n    If offline authorization checks are necessary within the mobile app’s code, developers should perform local integrity checks to detect unauthorized code changes.\n\nExample Attack Scenarios\n\nThe following scenarios showcase weak authentication or authorization controls in mobile apps:\n\nScenario #1: Hidden Service Requests: Developers assume that only authenticated users will be able to generate a service request that the mobile app submits to its backend for processing. During the processing of the request, the server code does not verify that the incoming request is associated with a known user. Hence, adversaries submit service requests to the back-end service and anonymously execute functionality that affects legitimate users of the solution.\n\nScenario #2: Interface Reliance: Developers assume that only authorized users will be able to see the existence of a particular function on their mobile app. Hence, they expect that only legitimately authorized users will be able to issue the request for the service from their mobile devices. The back-end code that processes the request does not bother to verify that the identity associated with the request is entitled to execute the service. Hence, adversaries are able to perform remote administrative functionality using fairly low-privilege user accounts.\n\nScenario #3: Usability Requirements: Due to usability requirements, mobile apps allow for passwords that are 4 digits long. The server code correctly stores a hashed version of the password. However, due to the severely short length of the password, an adversary will be able to quickly deduce the original passwords using rainbow hash tables. If the password file (or data store) on the server is compromised, an adversary will be able to quickly deduce users’ passwords.\n\nScenario #4: Insecure Direct Object Reference: A user makes an API endpoint request to a backend REST API that includes an actor ID and an OAuth bearer token. The user includes their actor ID as part of the incoming URL and includes the access token as a standard header in the request. The backend verifies the presence of the bearer token but fails to validate the actor ID associated with the bearer token. As a result, the user can tweak the actor ID and attain the account information of other users as part of the REST API request.\n\nScenario #5: Transmission of LDAP roles: A user makes an API endpoint request to a backend REST API that includes a standard oAuth bearer token along with a header that includes a list of LDAP groups that the user belongs to. The backend request validates the bearer token and then inspects the incoming LDAP groups for the right group membership before continuing on to the sensitive functionality. However, the backend system does not perform an independent validation of LDAP group membership and instead relies upon the incoming LDAP information coming from the user. The user can tweak the incoming header and report to be a member of any LDAP group arbitrarily and perform administrative functionality.",

This vulnerability can be exploited in the following ways:\n\nInsufficient Input Validation: When user input is not thoroughly checked, attackers can manipulate it by entering unexpected or malicious data. This can bypass security measures and lead to code execution vulnerabilities or unauthorized system access.\n\nInsufficient Output Validation: If output data is not properly validated and sanitized, attackers can inject malicious scripts that get executed by users’ browsers. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, enabling data theft, session hijacking, or the manipulation of displayed content.\n\nLack of Contextual Validation: Failing to consider the specific context or expected data formats can result in vulnerabilities like SQL injection or format string vulnerabilities. These occur when unvalidated user input is directly incorporated into database queries or improperly handled in format string functions, allowing attackers to manipulate queries or execute arbitrary code.\n\nFailure to Validate Data Integrity: Without validating data integrity, the application becomes vulnerable to data corruption or incorrect processing.

When the data transmission takes place, it typically goes through the mobile device’s carrier network and the internet, a threat agent listening on the wire can intercept and modify the data if it transmitted in plaintext or using a deprecated encryption protocol. Threat agents might have different motives such as stealing sensitive information, conducting espionage, identity theft and more. The following threat agents exist:\n\n    An adversary that shares your local network (compromised or monitored Wi-Fi);\n    Rogue carrier or network devices (routers, cell towers, proxy’s, etc); or\n    Malware on your mobile device.\n\nAttack Vectors\n\nExploitability EASY\n\nWhile modern applications do reply on cryptographic protocols such as SSL/TLS, they can sometimes have flaws in their implementations like:\n\n    Using deprecated protocols and/or bad configuration settings;\n    Accepting bad ssl certificates (self-signed, revoked, expired, wrong host…); or\n    Inconsistency (having SSL/TLS only on select workflows such as authentication).\n\nSecurity Weakness\n\nPrevalence COMMON\n\nDetectability AVERAGE\n\nWhile modern mobile applications aim to protect network traffic, they often have inconsistencies in their implementation. These inconsistencies can lead to vulnerabilities that expose data and session IDs to interception. Just because an app uses transport security protocols doesn’t mean it’s implemented correctly. To identify basic flaws, you can observe the network traffic on the phone. However, detecting more subtle flaws requires a closer look at the application’s design and configuration.\nTechnical Impacts\n\nImpact SEVERE\n\nThis flaw can expose user data which might lead to account takeover, user impersonation, PII data leaks and more, for instance an attacker might intercept user credentials, session, 2FA tokens which can open the door for more elaborate attacks.\nBusiness Impacts\n\nImpact MODERATE\n\nAt a minimum, interception of sensitive data through a communication channel will result in a privacy violation.\n\nThe violation of a user’s confidentiality may result in:\n\n    Identity theft;\n    Fraud, or\n    Reputational Damage.\n\nAm I Vulnerable To ‘Insecure Communication’?\n\nThis risk covers all aspects of getting data from point A to point B, but doing it insecurely.

Some examples of sensitive data include encryption keys, passwords, private user information, account details, session tokens, documents, metadata, and binaries. The sensitive data can be coming to the device from a server, it can be coming from an app out to a server, or it might be going between the device and something else local (e.g., an NFC terminal or NFC card). The defining characteristic of this risk is the existence of two devices and some data passing between them.\n\nIf the data is being stored locally in the device itself, that’s #Insecure Data. If the session details are communicated securely (e.g., via a strong TLS connection) but the session identifer itself is bad (perhaps it is predictable, low entropy, etc.), then that’s an #Insecure Authentication problem, not a communication problem.\n\nThe usual risks of insecure communication are around data integrity, data confidentiality, and origin integrity. If the data can be changed while in transit, without the change being detectable (e.g., via a man-in-the-middle attack) then that is a good example of this risk. If confidential data can be exposed, learned, or derived by observing the communications as it happens (i.e., eavesdropping) or by recording the conversation as it happens and attacking it later (offline attack), that’s also an insecure communication problem. Failing to properly setup and validate a TLS connection (e.g., certificate checking, weak ciphers, other TLS configuration problems) are all here in insecure communication.\nHow Do I Prevent ‘Insecure Communication’?\n\nGeneral Best Practices\n\n    Assume that the network layer is not secure and is susceptible to eavesdropping.\n    Apply SSL/TLS to transport channels that the mobile app will use to transmit data to a backend API or web service.\n    Account for outside entities like third-party analytics companies, social networks, etc. by using their SSL versions when an application runs a routine via the browser/webkit. Avoid mixed SSL sessions as they may expose the user’s session ID.\n    Use strong, industry standard cipher suites with appropriate key lengths.\n    Use certificates signed by a trusted CA provider.\n    Never allow bad certificates (self-signed, expired, untrusted root, revoked, wrong host..).\n    Consider certificate pinning.\n    Always require SSL chain verification.\n    Only establish a secure connection after verifying the identity of the endpoint server using trusted certificates in the key chain.\n    Alert users through the UI if the mobile app detects an invalid certificate.\n    Do not send sensitive data over alternate channels (e.g, SMS, MMS, or notifications).\n    If possible, apply a separate layer of encryption to any sensitive data before it is given to the SSL channel. In the event that future vulnerabilities are discovered in the SSL implementation, the encrypted data will provide a secondary defense against confidentiality violation.\n    During development cycles, avoid overriding SSL verification methods to allow untrusted certificates, instead try using self-signed certificates or a local development certificate authority (CA)\n    During security assessments, it is advised to analyze application traffic to see if any traffic goes through plaintext channels\n\niOS Specific Best Practices\n\nDefault classes in the latest version of iOS handle SSL cipher strength negotiation very well. Trouble comes when developers temporarily add code to bypass these defaults to accommodate development hurdles. In addition to the above general practices:\n\n    Ensure that certificates are valid and fail closed.\n    When using CFNetwork, consider using the Secure Transport API to designate trusted client certificates. In almost all situations, NSStreamSocketSecurityLevelTLSv1 should be used for higher standard cipher strength.\n    After development, ensure all NSURL calls (or wrappers of NSURL) do not allow self signed or invalid certificates such as the NSURL class method setAllowsAnyHTTPSCertificate.\n    Consider using certificate pinning by doing the following: export your certificate, include it in your app bundle, and anchor it to your trust object. Using the NSURL method connection:willSendRequestForAuthenticationChallenge: will now accept your cert.\n\nAndroid Specific Best Practices\n\n    Remove all code after the development cycle that may allow the application to accept all certificates such as org.apache.http.conn.ssl.AllowAllHostnameVerifier or SSLSocketFactory.ALLOW_ALL_HOSTNAME_VERIFIER. These are equivalent to trusting all certificates.\n    If using a class which extends SSLSocketFactory, make sure checkServerTrusted method is properly implemented so that server certificate is correctly checked.\n    Avoid overriding onReceivedSslError to allow invalid SSL certificates\n\nExample Attack Scenarios\n\nThere are a few common scenarios that penetration testers frequently discover when inspecting a mobile app’s communication security:\n\nLack of certificate inspection\n\nThe mobile app and an endpoint successfully connect and perform a TLS handshake to establish a secure channel. However, the mobile app fails to inspect the certificate offered by the server and the mobile app unconditionally accepts any certificate offered to it by the server. This destroys any mutual authentication capability between the mobile app and the endpoint. The mobile app is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks through a TLS proxy.\n\nWeak handshake negotiation\n\nThe mobile app and an endpoint successfully connect and negotiate a cipher suite as part of the connection handshake. The client successfully negotiates with the server to use a weak cipher suite that results in weak encryption that can be easily decrypted by the adversary. This jeopardizes the confidentiality of the channel between the mobile app and the endpoint.\n\nPrivacy information leakage\n\nThe mobile app transmits personally identifiable information to an endpoint via non-secure channels instead of over SSL/TLS. This jeopardizes the confidentiality of any privacy-related data between the mobile app and the endpoint.\n\nCredential information leakage\n\nThe mobile app transmits user credentials to an endpoint via non-secure channels instead of over SSL/TLS. This allows an adversary to intercept those credentials in cleartext.\n\nTwo-Factor authentication bypass\n\nThe mobile app receives a session identifier from an endpoint via non-secure channels instead of over SSL/TLS. This allows an adversary to bypass two-factor authentication by using the intercepted session identifier.",

        "title": "M6: Inadequate Privacy Controls",
        "poc": "",
        "desc": "Threat Agents\n\nApplication Specific\n\nPrivacy controls are concerned with protecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII), e.g., names and addresses, credit card information, e-mail and IP addresses, information about health, religion, sexuality and political opinions.\n\nThis information is valuable to attackers for several reasons. For example, an attacker could\n\n    Impersonate the victim to commit a fraud,\n    Misuse the victim’s payment data,\n    Blackmail the victim with sensitive information or\n    Harm the victim by destroying or manipulating the victim’s critical data.\n\nIn general, PII could either be leaked (i.e., a violation of confidentiality), manipulated (violation of integrity) or destroyed/blocked (violation of availability).\nAttack Vectors\n\nExploitability AVERAGE\n\nTypical sources for PII are well protected, e.g., the sandbox of the app, the network communication with the server, the app’s logs and backups. Some have less protection but are still hard to access, like URL query parameters and clipboard content.\n\nObtaining PII thus requires the attacker to first breach security on another level. Attackers could eavesdrop on the network communication, access file system, clipboard, or logs with a trojan or get their hands on the mobile device and create a backup to analyze. Since PII is just data that can be stored, processed, and transmitted by all means available on mobile devices, the possibilities to extract or manipulate it are manifold.\nSecurity Weakness\n\nPrevalence COMMON\n\nDetectability EASY\n\nAlmost all apps process some kind of PII. Many even collect and process more than they need to fulfill their purpose, which makes them more attractive as a target without business needs.\n\nRisks of privacy violations increase due to careless handling of PII by developers. PII should always be processed with the possibility in mind that an attacker could access communication and storage media.\n\nHence, an app is vulnerable to privacy infringements if some personal data it collects motivates an attacker to manipulate or abuse that data through a storage or transmission medium that is insufficiently secured.\nTechnical Impacts\n\nImpact LOW\n\nPrivacy violations usually have little technical impact on the system as a whole. Only if the PII includes information like authentication data, it can affect certain global security properties, e.g., traceability.\n\nIf user data is manipulated it might render the system unusable for that user. Through ill-formed data, also the backend may be disturbed if it is missing proper sanitization and exception handling.\nBusiness Impacts\n\nImpact SEVERE\n\nThe extent and severity of the business impact, which a privacy violation has, strongly depends on the number of affected users, the criticality of the affected data, and the data protection regulations that apply where the violation happened. The business impact of privacy violations will typically result in the following at a minimum:\n\nViolation of legal regulations: Regulations are the biggest issue regarding privacy controls. GDPR (Europe), CCPA (California, US), PDPA (Singapore), PIPEDA (Canada), LGPD (Brazil), Data Protection Act 2018 (UK), POPIA (South Africa), PDPL (China) are examples of relevant regulations with known sanctions against companies for not protecting their users’ data.\n\nFinancial damage due to victims’ lawsuits: Whoever is personally affected by a privacy violation might sue the app provider that let the violation happen. These lawsuits might be successful, depending on the legal regulations that apply and the ability of the provider to show that they hat adequate and up to date protection mechanisms in place.\n\nReputational damage: If a privacy violation affects users on a large scale, it is likely published in media, thus, generating negative publicity for the provider of the app. As a consequence, sales and usage for the app and even other, unrelated products of the same provider might drop.\n\nLoss or theft of PII: Actual information stolen might be misused, even for attacks on the provider of the app. For example, specific user data could be used to employ a social engineering attack on the provider by impersonating a victim.\nAm I Vulnerable To ‘Inadequate Privacy Controls’?\n\nAn app can only be vulnerable to Inadequate Privacy Controls if it processes some form of personally identifiable information. This is almost always the case: Client apps’ IP addresses visible to a server, logs of the apps’ usage, and metadata sent with crash reports or analytics are PII that apply to most apps. Usually, an app will collect and process additional, more sensitive PII from its users, like accounts, payment data, locations and more.\n\nGiven an app that uses PII, it might expose it like any other sensitive data. This most notably happens through\n\n    Insecure data storage and communication (cf. M5, M9),\n    Data access with insecure authentification and authorization (cf. M3, M1), and\n    Insider attacks on the app’s sandbox (cf. M2, M4, M8).\n\nThe other OWASP Mobile Top 10 risks provide deeper insights on how an app might be vulnerable to the different attack vectors.\nHow Do I Prevent ‘Inadequate Privacy Controls’?\n\nSomething that does not exist cannot be attacked, so the safest approach to prevent privacy violations is to minimize the amount and variety of PII that is processed. This requires full awareness of all PII assets in a given app. With that awareness, the following questions should be assessed:\n\n    Is all PII processed really necessary, e.g., name and address, gender, age?\n    Can some of the PII be replaced by less critical information, e.g., fine-grained location by coarse-grained location?\n    Can some of the PII be reduced, e.g., location updates every hour instead of every minute?\n    Can some of the PII be anonymized or blurred, e.g., by hashing, bucketing, or adding noise?\n    Can some of the PII be deleted after some expiration period, e.g., only keep health data of the last week?\n    Can users consent to optional PII usage, e.g., to receive a better service but also be aware of the additional risk?\n\nThe remaining PII should not be stored or transferred unless absolutely necessary. If it must be stored or transferred, access must be protected with proper authentication and possibly authorization. Also defense in depth should be considered for particularly critical data. For example, health data may be encrypted with a key sealed in the device’s TPM in addition to its storage in the app’s sandbox. So, if an attacker manages to circumvent the sandbox restrictions, the data is still not readable. The other OWASP Mobile Top 10 risks suggest measures to securely store, transfer, access and otherwise handle sensitive data.\n\nThreat modeling can be used to determine the most likely ways that privacy violations may occur in a given app. The effort of securing PII could then be focused on these.\n\nStatic and dynamic security checking tools might reveal common pitfalls, like logging of sensitive data or leakage to clipboard or URL query parameters.\nExample Attack Scenarios\n\nThe following scenarios showcase inadequate privacy controls in mobile apps:\n\nScenario #1: Inadequate sanitization of logs and error messages.\n\nReporting of logs and exceptions is essential for quality assurance of a productive app. Crash reports and other usage data helps developers to fix bugs and learn about how their app is used. However, logs and error messages might contain PII if the developers chose to include this data in log or error messages. Also, third party libraries might include PII in their error messages and logs as well. An example of a frequent issue are database exceptions that reveal part of the query or result. This will most likely be visible to any platform provider used for collecting and evaluating crash reports. It might also become visible to the user if the error is displayed on screen or to attackers who can read device logs. Developers should be especially careful in what they log and ensure that exception messages are sanitized before displaying them to the user or reporting them to a server.\n\nScenario #2: Using PII in URL query parameters.\n\nURL query parameters are often used to transmit request arguments to a server. However, URL query parameters are visible at least in the server logs, but often also in website analytics and possibly in the local browser history. So sensitive information should never be transmitted as query parameters. Instead, they should be sent as a header or part of the body.\n\nScenario #3: Exclusion of personal data in backups/not setting hasFragileUserData.\n\nMost PII processed by an app is stored in its sandbox. The app should explicitly configure what data to include in device backups. An attacker might obtain a device and create a backup or get a backup from another source, from which the sandbox content could be extracted.\n\nAlternatively, by setting hasFragileUserData to ‘true’ in Android, an app may preserve its data upon uninstallation. An attacker who manages to install a malicious app with the same package id later can access this data.\n\nHence, both settings should be explicitly set for apps to make the developers’ intent transparent and to control the information flow through backups or between subsequent installations of an app.",

        "title": "M7: Insufficient Binary Protection",
        "poc": "",
        "desc": "Threat Agents\n\nApplication Specific\n\nAttackers who target app binaries are motivated by various reasons.\n\nThe binary could contain valuable secrets, such as commercial API keys or hardcoded cryptographic secrets that an attacker could misuse. In addition, the code in the binary could be valuable on its own, for example, because it contains critical business logic or pre-trained AI models. Some attackers might also not target the app itself but use it to explore potential weaknesses of the corresponding backend to prepare for an attack.\n\nBesides collecting information, attackers could also manipulate app binaries to access paid features for free or to bypass other security checks. In the worst case, popular apps could be modified to contain malicious code and be distributed via third-party app stores or under a new name to exploit unsuspecting users. One common attack example is reconfiguring the payment identifiers in an app, repackaging it, and distributing it via app stores. Then, when users download this unauthorized copy from the app store, the attacker receives the payments instead of the original provider.\nAttack Vectors\n\nExploitability EASY\n\nApp binaries usually can be downloaded from the app stores or copied from mobile devices, so binary attacks are easy to set up.\n\nAn app binary could be subject to two types of attacks:\n\n    Reverse engineering: The app binary is decompiled and scanned for valuable information, like secret keys, algorithms, or vulnerabilities.\n    Code tampering: The app binary is manipulated, e.g., to remove license checks, circumvent paywalls or obtain other benefits as a user. Alternatively, the app can be manipulated to contain malicious code.\n\nSecurity Weakness\n\nPrevalence COMMON\n\nDetectability EASY\n\nAll apps are vulnerable to binary attacks and many will end up the subject of some form of an attack at some time. Those apps that have sensitive data or algorithms hardcoded into their binary are particularly vulnerable to binary attacks. These apps should employ countermeasures to fend off potential attackers long enough so that an attacker will give up because the cost of successfully breaking the protection would be more expensive than the gain from that success. Oftentimes, e.g., in case of copy protection, it is sufficient to prolongate the cracking process until the targeted revenue from app sales has been reached.\n\nIn general, fully compiled apps like iOS apps are less susceptible to reverse engineering and code tampering than higher-level bytecode found in Android apps (note that this might not hold for apps developed with cross-platform technologies, like PWA or Flutter).\n\nEspecially popular apps are likely to be manipulated and redistributed through app stores. Detecting and removing these manipulated copies is offered by specialized companies but is also possible with certain detection and reporting mechanisms within the apps themselves.\n\nNote that there are no fully reliable mechanisms to prevent binary attacks. Defending against them is an arms race between the developers investing in countermeasures and attackers who break these measures. So, the question to be answered for each app is: How much effort should be put into measures against binary attacks?\nTechnical Impacts\n\nImpact MODERATE\n\nAs stated before, a binary attack could either happen as reverse engineering and leak information from the app binary or as code tampering and alter how the app works.\n\nIf secrets leak, they must be replaced quickly throughout the system, which is difficult if the secrets are hardcoded in the app. Information leakage from the binary also has the potential to reveal security vulnerabilities in the backend.\n\nYet, manipulation has even more impact on the technical soundness of a system. By manipulation of the binaries, attackers could change how apps work arbitrarily, for example to their own benefit or to disturb the backends, if they are insufficiently hardened against such malicious requests.\nBusiness Impacts\n\nImpact MODERATE\n\nLeakage of API keys for commercial APIs or similar can cause significant costs if they are misused on a large scale. The same holds for apps that are tampered with to remove license checks or to publish their functionality with a competing app. In both cases, individuals cracking an app or stealing an API key for personal use will likely go unnoticed. However at scale, for example when API keys or even functionality is systematically used with other apps, malicious competitors might get a significant advantage because they have significantly lower costs.\n\nThe business model of the app developers may be threatened even more if intellectual property, like algorithms or AI models that have been developed with great effort, becomes public or is stolen by a malicious competitor.\n\nGreat reputational damage could arise in particular for popular apps that get redistributed with malicious code. Even though the app provider can hardly prevent redistribution of a tampered copy of its app, the negative publicity will likely be directed at the original provider. Hence, redistribution of unauthorized copies should be made as difficult as possible for an attacker to reduce the probability of this risk.\nAm I Vulnerable To ‘Insufficient Binary Protection’?\n\nAll apps are vulnerable to binary attacks. Binary attacks can become particularly harmful if the app has sensitive data or algorithms hardcoded in its binary or if it is very popular. If there are additional protective measures, like obfuscation, encoding of secrets in native code (for Android) or similar, successful attacks become harder to achieve but never impossible.\n\nWhether the app is sufficiently secure depends on the business impact that different binary attacks could have. The more motivating it is for attackers and the greater the impact would be, the more effort should be put into protection. Hence, “vulnerability” to binary attacks is highly specific to the given app.\n\nFor a quick check, developers can inspect their own app binaries using similar tools as attackers would use. There are many free or affordable tools, like MobSF, otool, apktool and Ghidra that are also quite easy to use and well documented.\nHow Do I Prevent ‘Insufficient Binary Protection’?\n\nFor each app, it should be assessed whether any critical content is contained in the binary or whether its popularity mandates binary protection. If yes, a threat modeling analysis helps to identify the highest risks and their expected financial impact in case they occur. For the most relevant risks, countermeasures should be taken.\n\nApps always run in untrusted execution environments and should only get the least necessary information they need to work, as this information is always at risk of being leaked or manipulated. But assuming that certain secrets, algorithms, security checks, and similar must be within the app’s binary, different attacks can be fended off by different means:\n\nReverse engineering: To prevent reverse engineering, the app binary should be made incomprehensible. This is supported by many free and commercial obfuscation tools. Compiling part of apps natively (iOS and Android) or using interpreters or nested virtual machines makes reverse engineering even harder, as many decompiling tools only support one language and binary format. This kind of obfuscation is a tradeoff between the complexity of the code and robustness against reverse engineering, as many libraries that rely on certain strings or symbols in the code will not work with full obfuscation. Developers could check the quality of their obfuscation by using the tools from the previous section.\n\nBreaking security mechanisms: Obfuscation also helps against manipulation, as an attacker must understand the control flow in order to skip security checks and like. In addition, local security checks should also be enforced by the backend. For example, required resources for a protected feature should only be downloaded if a check succeeds locally and in the backend. Finally, integrity checks could detect code tampering and render the app installation unusable, e.g., by deleting some resources. However, such an integrity check could also be found and deactivated as any other local security check.\n\nRedistribution (with malicious code): Integrity checks, e.g., on startup, could also detect redistribution and modification of app binaries. These violations could automatically be reported to find and remove the unauthorized copies of the app from the app stores before they become widespread. There are also specialized companies that support this use case.\nExample Attack Scenarios\n\nScenario #1 Hardcoded API keys: Assume an app uses a commercial API where it must pay a small fee for each call. These calls would be easily paid for by the subscription fee the users pay for that app. However, the API key used for access and billing is hardcoded in the app’s unprotected binary code. An attacker who wants access could reverse engineer the app with free tools and get access to the secret string. Since API access is only protected with the API key and no additional user authentication, the attacker can freely work on the API or even sell the API key. In the worst case, the API keys could be misused a lot, causing substantial financial damage to the provider of the app, or at least blocking legitimate users of the app if the API access is rate-limited.\n\nScenario #2 Disabling payment and license checks: A mobile game might publish its app and the first levels for free. If the users like the game, they pay for full access. All the resources for the later levels are shipped with the app. They are only protected by a license check, where the license is downloaded when the user pays. An attacker could reverse engineer the app and try to understand how the verification of the payment happens. If the app binary is not sufficiently protected, it is easy to locate the license check and just replace it with a static success statement. The attacker can then recompile the app and play it for free or even sell it under another name in the app stores.\n\nScenario #3 Hardcoded AI models: Assume a medical app that features an AI to answer user requests given as speech or free text inputs needs. This app includes its specialized and quality-assured AI model in its source code to enable offline access and avoid hosting own download servers. This AI model is the most valuable asset of this app and took many person-years in development. An attacker might try to extract this model from the source code and sell it to competitors. If the app binary is insufficiently protected, the attacker could not only access the AI model, but also learn how it is used, selling this information along with the AI training parameters.",

Threat agents who can exploit security misconfigurations are attackers aiming to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or perform malicious actions. Threat agents can be an attacker with physical access to the device, a malicious app on the device that exploits security misconfiguration to execute unauthorized actions on the target vulnerable application context.\nAttack Vectors\n\nExploitability DIFFICULT\n\nSecurity misconfigurations in mobile apps can be exploited through various attack vectors, including:\n\n    Insecure default settings: Mobile apps often come with default configurations that may have weak security settings or unnecessary permissions enabled, making them vulnerable to attacks.\n    Improper access controls: Misconfigured access controls can allow unauthorized users to access sensitive data or perform privileged actions.\n    Weak encryption or hashing: Improperly implemented or weak encryption and hashing algorithms can be exploited to gain access to sensitive information.\n    Lack of secure communication: Failure to use secure communication protocols, such as SSL/TLS, can expose sensitive data to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n    Unprotected storage: Storing sensitive data, such as passwords or API keys, in an insecure manner, such as plain text or weakly encrypted, can lead to unauthorized access.\n    Insecure file permissions: Storing application files with world-readable and/or world-writable permissions.\n    Misconfigured session management: Improper session management can result in session hijacking, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users.\n\nSecurity Weakness\n\nPrevalence COMMON\n\nDetectability EASY\n\nSecurity misconfigurations are common in mobile apps due to factors such as time constraints, lack of awareness, or human error during development. Detecting security misconfigurations is relatively easy through manual code review, security testing, or automated scanning tools.\n\nExamples of security misconfigurations include:\n\n    Failure to disable debugging features in release builds, which can expose sensitive information.\n    Allowing insecure communication protocols, such as HTTP, instead of enforcing secure communication over HTTPS.\n    Leaving default usernames and passwords unchanged, providing easy access to attackers.\n    Inadequate access controls that allow unauthorized users to perform privileged actions.\n\nTechnical Impacts\n\nImpact SEVERE\n\nSecurity misconfigurations can have significant technical impacts on mobile apps, including:\n\n    Unauthorized access to sensitive data: Misconfigurations may allow attackers to access sensitive information, such as user credentials, personal data, or confidential business data.\n    Account hijacking or impersonation: Weak or misconfigured authentication mechanisms can lead to account takeover or impersonation of legitimate users.\n    Data breaches: Inadequate security configurations may result in data breaches, exposing sensitive data to unauthorized individuals.\n    Compromise of backend systems: Misconfigurations in the mobile app can provide attackers with a foothold to compromise the backend systems or infrastructure.\n\nBusiness Impacts\n\nImpact SEVERE\n\nSecurity misconfigurations can have severe business impacts, including:\n\n    Financial loss: Breaches resulting from security misconfigurations can lead to financial losses, including legal penalties, regulatory fines, and damage to the organization’s reputation.\n    Data loss or theft: Misconfigurations can result in the loss or theft of sensitive data, leading to legal and financial consequences.\n    Downtime and disruption: Exploitation of security misconfigurations can lead to app downtime, service disruption, or compromised functionality, affecting user experience and business operations.\n    Damage to brand reputation: Publicly disclosed security incidents can damage the organization’s reputation, leading to loss of customer trust and potential loss of business.\n\nAm I Vulnerable to Security Misconfigurations?\n\nMobile apps are vulnerable to security misconfigurations if they have not been properly configured to follow security best practices. Common indicators of vulnerability to security misconfigurations include:\n\n    Default settings not reviewed: Using default configurations without reviewing security settings, permissions and default credentials.\n    Lack of secure communication: Using unencrypted or weakly encrypted communication channels.\n    Weak or absent access controls: Allowing unauthorized access to sensitive functionality or data.\n    Failure to update or patch: Not applying necessary security updates or patches to the app or underlying components.\n    Improper storage of sensitive data: Storing sensitive data in plain text or weakly protected formats.\n    Insecure file provider path settings: a file content provider that was meant for internal application use is exposed to other apps or users, which could potentially compromise sensitive data or allow unauthorized access to application resources.\n    Exported activities: an activity that is meant for internal application use is exported and/or browsable, which exposes an additional attack surface.\n\nTo determine if your app is vulnerable to security misconfigurations, you should conduct a thorough security assessment, including code review, security testing, and configuration analysis.\nHow Do I Prevent Security Misconfigurations?\n\nPreventing security misconfigurations in mobile apps requires following secure coding and configuration practices. Here are some key prevention measures:\n\n    Secure default configurations: Ensure that default settings and configurations are properly secured and do not expose sensitive information or provide unnecessary permissions.\n    Default credentials: Refrain from using hardcoded default credentials.\n    Insecure permissions: Avoid storing application files with overly permissive permissions like world-readable and/or world-writable.\n    Least privilege principle: Request only the permissions necessary for the proper functioning of the application\n    Secure network configuration: Disallow cleartext traffic and use certificate pinning when possible.\n    Disable Debugging: Disable debugging features in the production version of the app.\n    Disable backup mode (Android): By disabling backup mode on Android devices, you prevent the inclusion of app data in the device’s backup, ensuring that sensitive data from the app is not stored in the device backup.\n    Limit application attack surface by only exporting activities, content providers and services that are necessary to be exported\n\nExample Attack Scenarios\n\nThe following scenarios showcase security misconfigurations in mobile apps:\n\nScenario #1: Insecure default settings.\n\nA mobile app is released with default settings that have weak security configurations enabled. This includes using insecure communication protocols, leaving default usernames and passwords unchanged, and not disabling debugging features in release builds. Attackers exploit these misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or perform malicious actions.\n\nScenario #2: Insecure file provider path settings.\n\nA mobile app exposes its root path in an exported file content provider, allowing other apps to access its resources.\n\nScenario #3: Overly permissive storage permissions.\n\nA mobile app that stores application shared preferences with world-readable permissions, allowing other apps to read them\n\nScenario #4: Exported activity.\n\nA mobile app exports some activity that is meant for internal use, giving attackers extra attack surface to the application.\n\nScenario #5: Unnecessary permissions.\n\nA mobile app requests excessive permissions that are not essential for its core functionality. For instance, a simple flashlight app requesting access to the user’s contacts, location, and camera. This exposes user data to unnecessary risks, as the app could potentially misuse the granted permissions or unintentionally leak sensitive information.",

Inadequate cryptography can result in non-compliance with these regulations, leading to legal consequences, fines, or sanctions imposed by regulatory authorities.\nAm I Vulnerable To ‘Insufficient Cryptography’?\n\nThere are several ways in which insecure cryptography and insecure hash functions can manifest in a mobile application:\n\nWeak Encryption Algorithms: The mobile app may use encryption algorithms that are known to be weak or vulnerable to attacks. These algorithms may have known weaknesses, be outdated, or lack the necessary level of security to protect sensitive data effectively.\n\nInsufficient Key Length: Inadequate key length can weaken the encryption strength. If the mobile app uses short or easily guessable encryption keys, it becomes easier for attackers to decrypt the encrypted data through brute-force or other cryptographic attacks.\n\nImproper Key Management: Poor key management practices, such as storing encryption keys insecurely or transmitting them in plain text, can expose the keys to unauthorized access. Attackers who gain access to the keys can decrypt the data without difficulty.\n\nFlawed Encryption Implementation: The encryption/decryption process itself may be implemented incorrectly or contain programming flaws. These implementation errors can introduce vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to bypass or weaken the encryption protections.\n\nInsecure Storage of Data/Encryption Keys: If the encryption keys are stored insecurely on the mobile device, such as in plain text or in easily accessible locations, attackers with physical or unauthorized access to the device can retrieve the keys and decrypt the protected data.The mobile application utilizes a weak encryption algorithm or uses encryption incorrectly, such as using a weak key or failing to properly encrypt all sensitive data. This can result in compromised data if the encryption is easily bypassed or decrypted by an attacker.\n\nLack of Secure Transport Layer: When transmitting encrypted data over networks, it is crucial to use secure transport layer protocols like HTTPS. If the mobile app fails to implement secure transport protocols, encrypted data may be vulnerable to interception or tampering during transmission.\n\nInsufficient Validation and Authentication: Inadequate validation and authentication of parties involved in the encryption process can weaken the overall security. Without proper validation, attackers can impersonate legitimate entities, intercept encrypted data, and manipulate it without detection.\n\nLack of Salting: Salting, the process of adding random data to the input before hashing, is essential for enhancing the security of passwords. Insecure hash functions may not support salting or may use weak salting methods, making password hashes susceptible to attacks like pre-computed tables or brute-force attacks.\nHow Do I Prevent ‘Insufficient Cryptography’?\n\nTo prevent “insufficient cryptography” vulnerabilities in the mobile application, consider the following best practices:\n\nUse Strong Encryption Algorithms: Implement widely accepted and secure encryption algorithms, such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), or Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).

Protect keys from unauthorized access, including restricting access to authorized personnel, encrypting keys at rest, and using secure key distribution mechanisms.\n\nImplement Encryption Correctly: Carefully implement encryption and decryption processes in the mobile application, adhering to established cryptographic libraries and frameworks. Avoid custom encryption implementations, as they are more prone to errors and vulnerabilities.\n\nSecure Storage of Encryption Keys: Ensure encryption keys are securely stored on the mobile device. Avoid storing keys in plain text or easily accessible locations. Consider using secure storage mechanisms provided by the operating system or utilizing hardware-based secure storage options.\n\nEmploy Secure Transport Layer: Use secure transport layer protocols, such as HTTPS (HTTP Secure), for transmitting encrypted data over networks. Implement proper certificate validation and ensure secure communication channels between the mobile app and backend systems.\n\nValidate and Authenticate: Implement strong validation and authentication mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of parties involved in the encryption process. Perform proper validation of certificates, digital signatures, or other mechanisms used for authentication.\n\nRegularly Update Security Measures: Stay informed about security updates, patches, and recommendations from cryptographic libraries, frameworks, and platform providers. Keep the mobile application and underlying cryptographic components up to date to address any identified vulnerabilities or weaknesses.\n\nConduct Security Testing: Perform thorough security testing, including cryptographic vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and code reviews. Identify and remediate any weaknesses or vulnerabilities discovered during the testing process.\n\nFollow Industry Standards and Best Practices: Stay updated with industry standards and best practices related to cryptography. Organizations like NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) provide guidelines and recommendations for secure cryptographic practices.\n\nUse Strong Hash Functions: Choose widely recognized and cryptographically secure hash functions like SHA-256 or bcrypt. These algorithms are designed to resist attacks and provide a high level of security.\n\nImplement Salting: Always use a strong random salt when hashing passwords. Salting adds an extra layer of security by making it harder for attackers to use precomputed tables or rainbow tables to crack passwords.\n\nUse Key Derivation Functions (KDFs): For password hashing, use Key Derivation Functions like PBKDF2, bcrypt, or scrypt. These functions are specifically designed for securely deriving cryptographic keys from passwords and provide additional security features like iteration counts to slow down brute-force attacks.\nExample Attack Scenarios\n\nScenario #1: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks - An attacker intercepts the communication between the mobile application and the server. Weak cryptography can enable attackers to decrypt the intercepted data, modify it, and re-encrypt it before forwarding it to the intended recipient. This can lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or the injection of malicious content.\n\nScenario #2: Brute-Force Attacks- Attackers systematically try various combinations of keys until they find the correct one to decrypt the data. Weak cryptography can shorten the time required for such attacks, potentially exposing sensitive information.\n\nScenario #3: Cryptographic Downgrade Attacks - Mobile applications may support multiple encryption protocols or algorithms to establish secure connections. If weak cryptography is allowed as a fallback option, attackers can exploit this weakness and force the application to use weak encryption. As a result, they can decrypt the intercepted data more easily and launch subsequent attacks.\n\nScenario #4: Key Management Vulnerabilities - Weak key management practices can undermine the security of the cryptographic systems used in mobile applications. For example, if encryption keys are stored insecurely or are easily guessable, attackers can gain unauthorized access to the keys and decrypt the encrypted data. This can result in data breaches and privacy violations.\n\nScenario #5: Crypto Implementation Flaws - Weak cryptography can also stem from implementation flaws in the mobile application itself. These flaws may include incorrect usage of cryptographic libraries, insecure key generation, improper random number generation, or insecure handling of encryption-related functions. Attackers can exploit these flaws to bypass or weaken the encryption protections.",
